This Python project, Path Finder, developed using Pygame, is an implementation of various algorithms to find paths in graphs. It utilizes fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts to efficiently find paths between nodes in a graph.

Features
Graph Representation: Supports both directed and undirected graphs.
Algorithm Implementation: Includes implementations of popular path-finding algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, and A* Search Algorithm.
Visualization: Provides visualization options to understand the pathfinding process visually.
User Interface: Offers a user-friendly interface for users to interact with and visualize the algorithms.
Custom Graphs: Allows users to create custom graphs and test algorithms on them.
